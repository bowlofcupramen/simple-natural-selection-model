Simple natural selection model. 

To run the program, simply run the runner.py file. 

Ensure that all files are in the same directory. 

Each individual "thing" is acts based on its neurons, whose connections are randomized to begin with. Each neuron will output a value depending on its input.  The criterion for survival can be modified. Only surviving "things" will reproduce in the next generation. The length of each generation and number of generations per simulation can be changed in the runner.py file.
